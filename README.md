# UART
This project contains a complete design and verification environment for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) module. The UART is implemented in Verilog and supports configurable data widths, parity options (even/odd), and variable baud rates. The verification environment is built using SystemVerilog with UVM (Universal Verification Methodology), enabling robust testing through constrained-random stimulus, self-checking mechanisms, and reusable components.

The goal of this project is to verify UART functionality thoroughly through simulation by covering a wide range of scenarios, including:

Basic data transmission and reception
Parity and frame error detection
Variable data lengths (5 to 8 bits)
Edge case and random data tests

This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating RTL design practices, verification methodology, and interface protocol behavior.
